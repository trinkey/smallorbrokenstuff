# Small or broken stuff
This is a lot of my python projects that are either broken, discontinued, or too small to have their own repository.

## Folders:
### Completed
This folder is for all of the **completed** projects that are either too small or for some other reason don't deserve their own repository.
### Disconinued
This folder is for discontinued/abandoned projects.
### Broken
This folder is for code that straigt up doesn't work. I may take the time to fix these eventually, but I may not.
